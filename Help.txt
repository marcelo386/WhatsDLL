for 64 bit compile first run msys mgw 64

then goto dll src directory

then run this command :

clang -shared *.c -o WhatsDll.dll


C:\DLLSource\NewDllSrc


for 32 bit compile just run msys mgw 32



its ok task end


what is the command for the 32 bits? I lost it

command for 32 and 64 is same just run msys 32 for 32 bit compile and msys 64 for 64 bit compile

ok. got it. thanks
